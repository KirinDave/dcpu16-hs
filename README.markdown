dcpu16-hs
=========

Implementation of Notch's [dcpu-16] CPU in Haskell. This project includes an
assembler and an emulator.

[dcpu-16]: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Status
------

We can assemble and compile at least Notch's example program, and this
[fibonacci] example.

[fibonacci]: https://github.com/jazzychad/dcpu-asm/blob/master/fib.d16

The assembler generates worse code than the code generated by Notch's assembler
because it never tries to inline literal values into the first word of an
instruction.

The emulator just runs until it crashes, there is no stopping strategy for now.

Building
--------

    cabal configure && cabal build

Running
-------

    ./dist/build/dcpu16-assembler/dcpu16-assembler examples/notch.s

This produces `a.out`.

    ./dist/build/dcpu16-emulator/dcpu16-emulator a.out

You should probably redirect the output to a file.
