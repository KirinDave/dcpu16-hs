dcpu16-hs
=========

Implementation of Notch's [dcpu-16] CPU in Haskell.

[dcpu-16]: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Status
------

The assembler can assemble Notch's test program.

It generates worse code than the code generated by Notch's assembler because it
never tries to inline literal values into the first word of an instruction.

The emulator seems to run Notch's test program.

The current strategy is to simulate 10000 instructions (*not* cycles). A better
strategy would be to stop when PC ends up after the code, but this would not
work for some hacks (e.g. programs that modify themselves).

Building
--------

    cabal configure && cabal build

Running
-------

    ./dist/build/dcpu16-assembler/dcpu16-assembler examples/notch.s

This produces `a.out`

    ./dist/build/dcpu16-emulator/dcpu16-emulator a.out

You should probably redirect the output to a file.
